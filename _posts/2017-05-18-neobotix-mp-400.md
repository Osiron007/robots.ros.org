## Neobotix Mobile Platform MP-400 

The mobile robot **MP-400** was designed for daily use in industrial applications. Its construction is based on the best elements of our well proven robots but also includes many innovative ideas.

The **MP-400's** primary task is the flexible material transport in intralogistics. This small, agile robot can cover connections that cannot be realised with stationary conveyors or traditional AGVs.

If required, the **MP-400** can also easily be used in more demanding applications. Other possible tasks include mobile manipulation with an integrated robot arm or the whole field of service robotics research.
